**Getting Started**

This quick guide will take you through on how you can run this project on your local machine 
and TEST the functionality of all endpoints.

1. Make sure you have Node.js on you machine.

To download it click https://nodejs.org/en/

2. **Clone the project on your machine.**
  
git clone https://github.com/habinezadalvan/Epic-Mail.git
  

3. Do ```npm install```
  
  To get dependencies
  
4. Run ```npm start``` to run the server.
  
    The server is set on localhost =3000 for this particular project
    So the part will be http://localhost:3000/
  
5. **Make sure you have postman app on you machine.**

  To download it follow the instructions on https://www.getpostman.com/
  
6. **Get on postman and test all the methods using the provided api endpoints at the beggining of this guide.**
```
  Example:
  Method: POST
  Path: http://localhost:3000/
  Endpoint: api/v1/messages
  
  ```
  
7. **Depending on the way this project is develop, models are ampty ARRAYs created to receive input from user.
**This means that to get any data you should first POST something.**

  So do POST on http://localhost:3000/api/v1/messages so that you can get them whenever you want to GET anything.
  
  -The following are the data struction for POST method
  
  1. **POST a message**
```  
  {
  
  "subject":"string",
  
  "message":"string"
  
  ”parentMessageId”:Integer,
  
  "status":"string"  // read, sent, unread/ draft
  
}
  
  ```
  
  2. **POST sign up user**
 ``` 
  {
	"email": "string",
	
	"firstName":"string",
	
	"lastName":"string",
	
	"password":"string",
	
 	 "confirmPassword":"string" 
	 
}
```


3.**POST login user**
```
 {
    "email": "string",
    
    "passWord":"string"
    
 }
 
 ```
NB: 
 1. **Here is an other option running the project with heroku**
 
    User https://christian-epicmail.herokuapp.com/ instead of http://localhost:3000/ 
    and add the rest of api endpoints as usual.
    
 2. **It would be better to view json result in your browser when you have jsonview chrome-extention in you chrom browser**.
    To install it look for JSONview on google.

8. **To run test**
<npm test>
